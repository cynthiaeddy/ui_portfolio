          I’ve been lucky enough to design across a variety of mediums, starting
          in print and making my way into digital early on—working on iPad and
          iPhone interfaces before they became the norm. After a software
          development bootcamp, I spent a few years coding and freelancing, but
          design has always been my true passion. Outside of work, I’m all about
          making—quilting, silversmithing, and experimenting in the kitchen.
          These creative outlets keep me inspired and shape my work in UX/UI.
          I’ve lived in New York for decades, and the city (plus my hiking trips
          around it) constantly sparks new ideas. Travel also feeds my
          creativity—recent trips to Croatia and an upcoming adventure in
          Merida, Mexico, are already inspiring new thoughts. Today, I bring
          together my design and tech experience to create digital experiences
          that are not only visually engaging but also intuitive and
          user-focused. Whether it's a website, app, or prototype, my goal is
          always to craft seamless, enjoyable user journeys.
