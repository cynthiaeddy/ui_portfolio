            I ended up creating unnecessary mid-fidelity pages that didn&apos;t
            align with the task flow and initially prioritized the desktop
            version for high-fidelity wireframes, which led to a rushed mobile
            design.

            I could have managed my time more effectively by adhering to the
            project scope and starting with the mobile version for a more
            cohesive user experience.

            This project highlighted the importance of defining goals and the
            steps necessary to clarify the UX experience. I also enhanced my
            user interviewing skills and learned to better evaluate project
            scope through consultations with my mentor and peers.
