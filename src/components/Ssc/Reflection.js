            What challenges did I face, and what do I think led to them?
          </h5>
          <h5 className='h5'>
            I discovered that users had varying interpretations of
            sustainability, with some perspectives being quite clear and others
            more ambiguous. The original design of the website was quite basic,
            lacking much of the information users expressed as important in my
            initial research. As I aimed to include the elements users
            considered essential for purchasing sustainable products, it became
            challenging to create a more comprehensive website within the
            timeframe. However, this process was ultimately rewarding as it
            allowed me to enhance the user experience significantly.

          <h5 className='leadin'>How could I have improved my approach?</h5>
          <h5 className='h5'>
            I could have reached out and questioned sustainability experts and
            content creators which might have helped in crafting more impactful
            messaging about the products.{' '}

          <h5 className='leadin'>What insights did I gain? </h5>
          <h5 className='h5'>
            I gained insights into the diverse interpretations of sustainability
            among users, highlighting how these views can affect engagement. The
            basic design of the site proved insufficient in meeting user needs,
            and the challenge of expanding it within a limited timeframe
            underscored the importance of prioritizing essential content. I also
            recognized that collaborating with experts could enhance
            sustainability messaging, improving user engagement and trust.{' '}
